# Experiment 4

Numerically calculates the coefficient of finite scaling adjustment to the infinite-lattice theory that changes the temperature at which the phase transition takes place.

Find the R^2 regression curve for various predictions for the model fitted to the data, take maximal R^2 as correct parameter prediction
