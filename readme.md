# Ising Model

A 3rd year Physics project carried out at the University of Cambridge by James Bernardi.

Theoretical details can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model

Final report is held in this directory. 

## Details
### main.py 
Contains the lattice model and spin-site models as objects, and contains all operations pertaining to updating the lattice.
	
### experiment_x
Each directory contains details of an experiment carried out on the lattice (e.g. varying temperature, magnetic field) to probe physical properties of the model.

### old_scripts
Contains old, improved iterations of the Ising Model 

### find_eq
Find the time taken for the lattice to reach equilibrium (and provide graphical evidence to satisfy user)
