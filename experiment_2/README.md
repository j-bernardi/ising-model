# Experiment 2
Calculate the autocorrelation of the fluctuation for various lattice sizes and various temperatures

Find the timescale tau over which fluctuations in spin u(t) x u(t+tau) decorrelate, where x is the autocorrelation operator.

Further experiments should only be performed when the lattice has decorrelated, for independent results
